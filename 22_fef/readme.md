#DISCO: I learned that the loading bar and image carousels were a bootstrap function which helped open my eyes to just how many websites used bootstrap for their website's features.

#Q: For the loading bar, how do you actually implement the progress of how much of the website has actually loaded with the loading bar?
#C: I see that the two side arrows move to the midpoint of the images every time you click it to turn to the next image. I think the images should all be the same dimension or have the arrows stay at a certain point so that the users don't have to constantly move their mouse to click the arrows.
#C: I think it would be nice if there was a way to keep all three text boxes open when you click on them to show more details.
