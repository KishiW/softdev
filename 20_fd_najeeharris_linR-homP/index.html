<title> foundation of foundations</title>
<h2> Foundation Overview</h2>
<p>Foundation is a highly customizable front end framework built with sass (an extension of css), html, and JS. Sass stands for "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets"
  and adds features such as nesting and variables to stylesheets and allows for easy customization of foundation componenets.
  Files created using SASS are processed to css files, and is why this page utilizes foundation without error.
   Below are just some examples of built in foundation features.
</p>
<h2> Text! </h2>
<p>Foundations adds a bunch of useful text features such as text alignments, subheaders, lead paragraphs, and bulleted/unbulleted lists.</p> <br>

<div class="row">
  <div class="columns">
    <p class="text-left"><strong>This text is left-aligned.</strong> Isaiah Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Lin was wandering through the wanders of the world. The Great Wall, the Great Pyramids, but nothing satisfied his hunger, his curiosity. This all changed when he stumbled across the fountain of Foundations, where he learned a new framework to design websites.</p>

    <p class="text-right"><strong>This text is right-aligned.</strong> Isaiah Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Lin was wandering through the wanders of the world. The Great Wall, the Great Pyramids, but nothing satisfied his hunger, his curiosity. This all changed when he stumbled across the fountain of Foundations, where he learned a new framework to design websites.</p>

    <p class="text-center"><strong>This text is center-aligned.</strong> Isaiah Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Lin was wandering through the wanders of the world. The Great Wall, the Great Pyramids, but nothing satisfied his hunger, his curiosity. This all changed when he stumbled across the fountain of Foundations, where he learned a new framework to design websites.</p>

    <p class="text-justify"><strong>This text is justified.</strong> Isaiah Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Lin was wandering through the wanders of the world. The Great Wall, the Great Pyramids, but nothing satisfied his hunger, his curiosity. This all changed when he stumbled across the fountain of Foundations, where he learned a new framework to design websites.</p>

<h2> Call outs</h2>
<div class="callout secondary">
  <h5>This is a secondary callout</h5>
  <p>It has an easy to override visual style, and is appropriately subdued.</p>
  <a href="#">It's dangerous to go alone, take this.</a>
</div>

<h2>Grids! </h2>
<p> The most interesting feature of Foundations is the XY Grid classes that help make organization easier. Defaults is that the entire width of the page is 12 cells. Shown below is an example from documentation (with added colors for clarity). Theres a lot of additional formatting / complicated style options you can do to XY grids.</p>
<br>
<p> Example grid showcasing different cell sizes</p>
<div class="grid-x" >
  <div class="cell" style="background-color: aqua;">full width cell</div>
</div>
<div class="grid-x">
  <div class="cell small-6" style="background-color: coral;">6 cells</div>
</div>
<div class="grid-x">
  <div class="cell medium-6 large-4" style="background-color: beige;">12/6/4 cells</div>
  <div class="cell medium-6 large-8" style="background-color: darkgoldenrod;">12/6/8 cells</div>
</div>
<br>
<p>With grids you can have both padding and margins</p>
<div class="grid-x grid-margin-x">
  <div class="cell medium-6 large-4" style="background-color: aqua;">12/6/4 cells</div>
  <div class="cell medium-6 large-8" style="background-color: coral;">12/6/8 cells</div>
</div>
<div class="grid-x grid-padding-x">
  <div class="cell medium-6 large-4" style="background-color: beige;">12/6/4 cells</div>
  <div class="cell medium-6 large-8" style="background-color: darkgoldenrod;">12/6/8 cells</div>
</div>
